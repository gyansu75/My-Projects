# [Project 1: 🏨 Hotel Booking & Cancellation Analysi]()

This is my first project I did for my Analytics Protfolio, where I build a recommendation system for a Hotel Bookings and Cancelations dataset.

## 📌 Project Overview

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
- What are the key factors that lead to hotel booking cancellations?
- How do customer demographics, booking channels, and lead time affect cancellations?
- Can we predict the likelihood of a booking being canceled?

---

## 📊 Data Identification
**Dataset:** `hotel_bookings.csv`  
**Key Columns Include:**
- Hotel type (`City Hotel`, `Resort Hotel`)
- Lead time
- Booking and arrival dates
- Number of adults, children, babies
- Market segment and distribution channel
- Deposit type and customer type
- Average Daily Rate (ADR)
- Special requests and previous cancellations

## 🧹 Data Exploration & Cleaning
### Steps:
1. **Import and Inspect Data**
   - Check dataset shape, column types, and sample records.
2. **Handle Missing Values**
   - Identify and impute or drop missing data appropriately.
3. **Remove Duplicates & Outliers**
   - Eliminate redundant rows and handle extreme ADR or lead time values.
4. **Feature Formatting**
   - Convert date columns, encode categorical variables, and create derived features if necessary.

## 🧠 Conclusion & Recommendations
- Highlight what the hotel management can do to reduce cancellations.
- Suggest data-driven improvements (e.g., incentives for early bookings, flexible pricing, or deposit policies).
